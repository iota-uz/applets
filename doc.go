// Package applets is the public API for building and integrating applets with
// the IOTA SDK and host applications. Import it directly:
//
//	import "github.com/iota-uz/applets"
//
// The implementation is split into internal packages (internal/api, internal/controller,
// internal/context, internal/rpc, internal/router, internal/stream, internal/registry,
// internal/validate, internal/security, internal/manifest). Only this root package
// is part of the library's public API.
